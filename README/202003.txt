Today is March 30. 
    It has been the third week to work from home. The first week is fine, with the inertia of work from office, I still worked. But the second week is horrible, especially after the Tuesday meeting presentation. I presented the pid of rftime for several spring momentum setting. It really works. Got the comments of make two gaus fit on aero. On Wednesday meet with Hem, shouted out all my understandings in my slides. Boyfriend says that I sounds so violent. I always though that I'm soft and gentle. Maybe not. Too tired to work after shouting. Didn't do it until Friday. Two fits fit better, but doesn't make too much sense. I guess it's just more parameters for two fits than one fit so that it fits better. But it doesn't really matter pid. To do same things on all run group, I need rftime cuts for all rungroups. So I wrote learn/make_json.cxx, to make rftime_cut.json. I didn't change numbers in rftime_cut.json, yet. Today I submit the job and got so many pdfs, too many, can't check them all. I need to copy paste latex to make a long slides for all. Still too many rungroups to copy and paste. Need to write a cxx to make latex. I hope this diary will record what did I do what did I learn on every work day. And help to record what does each of my scripts do.
