#This is for yield calculating. 
  statistic_runs_D2/Dummy.cxx: main script. It founds cuts in db2/all_cuts.json, apply all cuts on data, write histograms into results/yield/kinematics/yield_runnumber.root, print check plots in results/yield/check/runnumber_neg/pos/.png. Print out statistic numbers in results/yield/run_info/"rungroup.json
  combine_json: after the first script, it prints all infos in separated json file for each rungroup, this one will combine all json files into /results/yield/run_info/runs_info.json. After this, need copy runs_info.json back to result/s/yield/ directory. 
#before actually plot the yield, need to go back to TE directory to write all tracking efficiencies into runs_info.json. This is done by shuo_analysis/TE/write_te_to_json.cxx. This script will read both runs_info.json and tracking_info.json, write TEs into results/Yield/runs_info_te.json. Need to change name to runs_info.json for further ploting
  plot_Q2x_June.cxx: this one will read all infos in runs_info.json, then plot yield and yield ratio for each kinematic settings. It will create one for each Q2x settings, then on each Q2x settings, plot all different z
  plot_Q2x_ratio_new.cxx: This one will read histograms in results/yield/kinematics/yield_runnumber, then rebin histograms and plot the yield ratio. Out plots are in results/yield/statistics/x_Q2_0.50_5.000_ratio.pdf
